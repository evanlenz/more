=== Welcome

Welcome to the Boost libraries! By the time you've completed this
tutorial, you'll be at least somewhat comfortable with the contents of a
Boost distribution and how to go about using it.

=== What's Here

This document is designed to be an _extremely_ gentle introduction, so
we included a fair amount of material that may already be very familiar
to you. To keep things simple, we also left out some information
intermediate and advanced users will probably want. At the end of this
document, we'll refer you on to resources that can help you pursue these
topics further.

=== Preliminaries

We use one typographic convention that might not be immediately obvious:
_italic_ text in examples is meant as a descriptive placeholder for
something else, usually information that you'll provide. For example:

*$* echo "My name is _your name_"

Here you're expected to imagine replacing the text “your name” with your
actual name.

=== Ready?

Let's go!
