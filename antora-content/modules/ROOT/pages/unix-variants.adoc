=== Get Boost

The most reliable way to get a copy of Boost is to download a
distribution from link:[SourceForge]:

[arabic]
. Download `.tar.bz2`_.
. In the directory where you want to put the Boost installation, execute
+
tar --bzip2 -xf _/path/to/_.tar.bz2

Other Packages

RedHat, Debian, and other distribution packagers supply Boost library
packages, however you may need to adapt these instructions if you use
third-party packages, because their creators usually choose to break
Boost up into several packages, reorganize the directory structure of
the Boost distribution, and/or rename the library binaries.footnote:[If
developers of Boost packages would like to work with us to make sure
these instructions can be used with their packages, we'd be glad to
help. Please make your interest known to the link:[Boost developers'
list].] If you have any trouble, we suggest using an official Boost
distribution from link:[SourceForge].

=== The Boost Distribution

This is a sketch of the resulting directory structure:

................._The “boost root directory”_::
  *index.htm* ........._A copy of www.boost.org starts here_ *boost*
  ........................._All Boost Header files_ *libs*
  ............__Tests, .cpp__s__, docs, etc., by library__ *index.html*
  ........_Library documentation starts here_ *algorithm* *any* *array*
  _…more libraries…_ *status* ........................._Boost-wide test
  suite_ *tools* ..........._Utilities, e.g. Boost.Build, quickbook,
  bcp_ *more* .........................._Policy documents, etc._ *doc*
  ..............._A subset of all Boost library docs_

*Header Organization*

The organization of Boost library headers isn't entirely uniform, but
most libraries follow a few patterns:

* Some older libraries and most very small libraries place all public
headers directly into `boost`.
* Most libraries' public headers live in a subdirectory of `boost`,
named after the library. For example, you'll find the Python library's
`def.hpp` header in
+
`boost``python``def.hpp`.
* Some libraries have an “aggregate header” in `boost` that `#include`s
all of the library's other headers. For example, link:[Boost.Python]'s
aggregate header is
+
`boost``python.hpp`.
* Most libraries place private headers in a subdirectory called
`detail`, or `aux_`. Don't expect to find anything you can use in these
directories.

It's important to note the following:

[[Boost root directory]]
[arabic]
. The path to the *boost root directory* (often ) is sometimes referred
to as `$BOOST_ROOT` in documentation and mailing lists .
. To compile anything in Boost, you need a directory containing the
`boost` subdirectory in your `#include` path.
. Since all of Boost's header files have the `.hpp` extension, and live
in the `boost` subdirectory of the boost root, your Boost `#include`
directives will look like:
+
#include <boost/_whatever_.hpp>
+
or
+
#include "boost/_whatever_.hpp"
+
depending on your preference regarding the use of angle bracket
includes.
. Don't be distracted by the `doc` subdirectory; it only contains a
subset of the Boost documentation. Start with `libs``index.html` if
you're looking for the whole enchilada.

=== Header-Only Libraries

The first thing many people want to know is, “how do I build Boost?” The
good news is that often, there's nothing to build.

Nothing to Build?

Most Boost libraries are *header-only*: they consist _entirely of header
files_ containing templates and inline functions, and require no
separately-compiled library binaries or special treatment when linking.

The only Boost libraries that _must_ be built separately are:

* link:[Boost.Chrono]
* link:[Boost.Context]
* link:[Boost.Filesystem]
* link:[Boost.GraphParallel]
* link:[Boost.IOStreams]
* link:[Boost.Locale]
* link:[Boost.Log] (see link:../../index.htm[build documentation])
* link:[Boost.MPI]
* link:[Boost.ProgramOptions]
* link:[Boost.Python] (see the link:[Boost.Python build documentation]
before building and installing it)
* link:[Boost.Regex]
* link:[Boost.Serialization]
* link:[Boost.Thread]
* link:[Boost.Timer]
* link:[Boost.Wave]

__ ../../libs/log/doc/html/log/installation/config.html __
../../libs/python/doc/html/building.html

A few libraries have optional separately-compiled binaries:

* link:[Boost.Graph] also has a binary component that is only needed if
you intend to link:[parse GraphViz files].
* link:[Boost.Math] has binary components for the TR1 and C99 cmath
functions.
* link:[Boost.Random] has a binary component which is only needed if
you're using `random_device`.
* link:[Boost.Test] can be used in “header-only” or “separately
compiled” mode, although *separate compilation is recommended for
serious use*.
* link:[Boost.Exception] provides non-intrusive implementation of
exception_ptr for 32-bit _MSC_VER==1310 and _MSC_VER==1400 which
requires a separately-compiled binary. This is enabled by #define
BOOST_ENABLE_NON_INTRUSIVE_EXCEPTION_PTR.
* link:[Boost.System] is header-only since Boost 1.69. A stub library is
still built for compatibility, but linking to it is no longer necessary.

__ ../../libs/graph/doc/read_graphviz.html

=== Build a Simple Program Using Boost

To keep things simple, let's start by using a header-only library. The
following program reads a sequence of integers from standard input, uses
Boost.Lambda to multiply each number by three, and writes them to
standard output:

....
#include <boost/lambda/lambda.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <algorithm>

int main() 
{
    using namespace boost::lambda;
    typedef std::istream_iterator<int> in;

    std::for_each( 
        in(std::cin), in(), std::cout << (_1 * 3) << " " );
}
....

Copy the text of this program into a file called `example.cpp`.

Now, in the directory where you saved `example.cpp`, issue the following
command:

c++ -I example.cpp -o example

To test the result, type:

echo 1 2 3 | ./example

==== Errors and Warnings

Don't be alarmed if you see compiler warnings originating in Boost
headers. We try to eliminate them, but doing so isn't always practical.
*Errors are another matter*. If you're seeing compilation errors at this
point in the tutorial, check to be sure you've copied the
link:#getting-started-on-unix-variants[example program] correctly and
that you've correctly identified the link:[Boost root directory].

__ link:[Build a Simple Program Using Boost]

=== Prepare to Use a Boost Library Binary

If you want to use any of the separately-compiled Boost libraries,
you'll need to acquire library binaries.

==== Easy Build and Install

Issue the following commands in the shell (don't type `$`; that
represents the shell's prompt):

*$* cd *$* ./bootstrap.sh --help

Select your configuration options and invoke `./bootstrap.sh` again
without the `--help` option. Unless you have write permission in your
system's `/usr/local/` directory, you'll probably want to at least use

*$* ./bootstrap.sh *--prefix=*_path_/_to_/_installation_/_prefix_

to install somewhere else. Also, consider using the `--show-libraries`
and `--with-libraries=`_library-name-list_ options to limit the long
wait you'll experience if you build everything. Finally,

*$* ./b2 install

will leave Boost binaries in the `lib/` subdirectory of your
installation prefix. You will also find a copy of the Boost headers in
the `include/` subdirectory of the installation prefix, so you can
henceforth use that directory as an `#include` path in place of the
Boost root directory.

__

==== Or, Build Custom Binaries

If you're using a compiler other than your system's default, you'll need
to use link:[Boost.Build] to create binaries.

You'll also use this method if you need a nonstandard build variant (see
the link:[Boost.Build documentation] for more details).

===== Install Boost.Build

link:[Boost.Build] is a text-based system for developing, testing, and
installing software. First, you'll need to build and install it. To do
this:

[arabic]
. Go to the directory `tools``build`.
. Run
. Run `b2 install --prefix=`_PREFIX_ where _PREFIX_ is the directory
where you want Boost.Build to be installed
. Add _PREFIX_`bin` to your PATH environment variable.

[[toolset-name]]
===== Identify Your Toolset[#toolset]####

First, find the toolset corresponding to your compiler in the following
table (an up-to-date list is always available [.title-ref]#in the
Boost.Build documentation#__).

__ ../../tools/build/doc/html/index.html#bbv2.reference.tools

[NOTE]
.Note
====
If you previously chose a toolset for the purposes of link:[building
b2], you should assume it won't work and instead choose newly from the
table below.
====

[width="100%",cols="14%,22%,64%",options="header",]
|===
|Toolset Name |Vendor |Notes
|`acc` |Hewlett Packard |Only very recent versions are known to work
well with Boost

|`borland` |Borland |

|`como` |Comeau Computing |Using this toolset may require configuring__
another toolset to act as its backend.

|`darwin` |Apple Computer |Apple's version of the GCC toolchain with
support for Darwin and MacOS X features such as frameworks.

|`gcc` |The Gnu Project |Includes support for Cygwin and MinGW
compilers.

|`hp_cxx` |Hewlett Packard |Targeted at the Tru64 operating system.

|`intel` |Intel |

|`msvc` |Microsoft |

|`sun` |Oracle |Only very recent versions are known to work well with
Boost. Note that the Oracle/Sun compiler has a large number of options
which effect binary compatibility: it is vital that the libraries are
built with the same options that your appliction will use. In particular
be aware that the default standard library may not work well with Boost,
_unless you are building for C++11_. The particular compiler options you
need can be injected with the b2 command line options `cxxflags=`and
`linkflags=`. For example to build with the Apache standard library in
C++03 mode use
`b2 cxxflags=-library=stdcxx4 linkflags=-library=stdcxx4`.

|`vacpp` |IBM |The VisualAge C++ compiler.
|===

__ link:[Boost.Build]

If you have multiple versions of a particular compiler installed, you
can append the version number to the toolset name, preceded by a hyphen,
e.g. `intel-9.0` or `borland-5.4.3`.

[[build-directory]]
===== Select a Build Directory[#build directory]####

link:[Boost.Build] will place all intermediate files it generates while
building into the *build directory*. If your Boost root directory is
writable, this step isn't strictly necessary: by default Boost.Build
will create a `bin.v2/` subdirectory for that purpose in your current
working directory.

===== Invoke `b2`

Change your current directory to the Boost root directory and invoke
`b2` as follows:

b2 *--build-dir=*_ *toolset=*_ ` ` stage

For a complete description of these and other invocation options, please
see the [.title-ref]#Boost.Build documentation#__.

__ ../../tools/build/doc/html/index.html#bbv2.overview.invocation

For example, your session might look like this:

$ cd ~/ $ b2 *--build-dir=*/tmp/build-boost **toolset=**gcc stage

That will build static and shared non-debug multi-threaded variants of
the libraries. To build all variants, pass the additional option,
“`--build-type=complete`”.

Building the special `stage` target places Boost library binaries in the
`stage``lib` subdirectory of the Boost tree. To use a different
directory pass the `--stagedir=`_directory_ option to `b2`.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
`b2` is case-sensitive; it is important that all the parts shown in
*bold* type above be entirely lower-case.
====

For a description of other options you can pass when invoking `b2`,
type:

....
b2 --help
....

In particular, to limit the amount of time spent building, you may be
interested in:

* reviewing the list of library names with `--show-libraries`
* limiting which libraries get built with the `--with-`_library-name_ or
`--without-`_library-name_ options
* choosing a specific build variant by adding `release` or `debug` to
the command line.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Boost.Build can produce a great deal of output, which can make it easy
to miss problems. If you want to make sure everything is went well, you
might redirect the output into a file by appending “`>build.log 2>&1`”
to your command line.
====

==== Expected Build Output

During the process of building Boost libraries, you can expect to see
some messages printed on the console. These may include

* Notices about Boost library configuration—for example, the Regex
library outputs a message about ICU when built without Unicode support,
and the Python library may be skipped without error (but with a notice)
if you don't have Python installed.
* Messages from the build tool that report the number of targets that
were built or skipped. Don't be surprised if those numbers don't make
any sense to you; there are many targets per library.
* Build action messages describing what the tool is doing, which look
something like:
+
_toolset-name_.c++ _long_/_path_/_to_/_file_/_being_/_built_
* Compiler warnings.

==== In Case of Build Errors

The only error messages you see when building Boost—if any—should be
related to the IOStreams library's support of zip and bzip2 formats as
described here__. Install the relevant development packages for libz and
libbz2 if you need those features. Other errors when building Boost
libraries are cause for concern.

__ ../../libs/iostreams/doc/installation.html

If it seems like the build system can't find your compiler and/or
linker, consider setting up a `user-config.jam` file as described
[.title-ref]#here#__. If that isn't your problem or the
`user-config.jam` file doesn't work for you, please address questions
about configuring Boost for your compiler to the link:[Boost Users'
mailing list].

__ ../../tools/build/doc/html/index.html#bbv2.overview.configuration

=== Link Your Program to a Boost Library

To demonstrate linking with a Boost binary library, we'll use the
following simple program that extracts the subject lines from emails. It
uses the link:[Boost.Regex] library, which has a separately-compiled
binary component. :

....
#include <boost/regex.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string line;
    boost::regex pat( "^Subject: (Re: |Aw: )*(.*)" );

    while (std::cin)
    {
        std::getline(std::cin, line);
        boost::smatch matches;
        if (boost::regex_match(line, matches, pat))
            std::cout << matches[2] << std::endl;
    }
}
....

There are two main challenges associated with linking:

[arabic]
. Tool configuration, e.g. choosing command-line options or IDE build
settings.
. Identifying the library binary, among all the build variants, whose
compile configuration is compatible with the rest of your project.

There are two main ways to link to libraries:

[upperalpha]
. You can specify the full path to each library:
+
$ c++ -I example.cpp -o example *\*::
  *~/boost/stage/lib/libboost_regex-gcc34-mt-d-1_36.a*
. You can separately specify a directory to search (with
`-L`_directory_) and a library name to search for (with
`-l`_library_,footnote:[That option is a dash followed by a lowercase
“L” character, which looks very much like a numeral 1 in some fonts.]
dropping the filename's leading `lib` and trailing suffix (`.a` in this
case):
+
$ c++ -I example.cpp -o example *\*::
  *-L~/boost/stage/lib/ -lboost_regex-gcc34-mt-d-1_36*
+
As you can see, this method is just as terse as method A for one
library; it _really_ pays off when you're using multiple libraries from
the same directory. Note, however, that if you use this method with a
library that has both static (`.a`) and dynamic (`.so`) builds, the
system may choose one automatically for you unless you pass a special
option such as `-static` on the command line.

In both cases above, the bold text is what you'd add to [.title-ref]#the
command lines we explored earlier#__.

==== Library Naming

In order to choose the right binary for your build configuration you
need to know how Boost binaries are named. Each library filename is
composed of a common sequence of elements that describe how it was
built. For example, `libboost_regex-vc71-mt-d-x86-1_34.lib` can be
broken down into the following elements:

`lib`::
  _Prefix_: except on Microsoft Windows, every Boost library name begins
  with this string. On Windows, only ordinary static libraries use the
  `lib` prefix; import libraries and DLLs do not.
`boost_regex`::
  _Library name_: all boost library filenames begin with `boost_`.
`-vc71`::
  _Toolset tag_: identifies the link:[toolset] and version used to build
  the binary.
`-mt`::
  _Threading tag_: indicates that the library was built with
  multithreading support enabled. Libraries built without multithreading
  support can be identified by the absence of `-mt`.
`-d`::
  _ABI tag_: encodes details that affect the library's interoperability
  with other compiled code. For each such feature, a single letter is
  added to the tag:
  +
  ____
  [width="100%",cols="7%,73%,20%",options="header",]
  |===
  |Key |Use this library when: |Boost.Build option
  |`s` |linking statically to the C++ standard library and compiler
  runtime support libraries. |runtime-link=static

  |`g` |using debug versions of the standard and runtime support
  libraries. |runtime-debugging=on

  |`y` |using a special [.title-ref]#debug build of Python#__.
  |python-debugging=on

  |`d` |building a debug version of your code. |variant=debug

  |`p` |using the STLPort standard library rather than the default one
  supplied with your compiler. |stdlib=stlport
  |===
  ____
  +
  For example, if you build a debug version of your code for use with
  debug versions of the static runtime library and the STLPort standard
  library, the tag would be: `-sgdp`. If none of the above apply, the
  ABI tag is ommitted.
`-x86`::
  _Architecture and address model tag_: in the first letter, encodes the
  architecture as follows:
  +
  ____
  [width="65%",cols="14%,40%,46%",options="header",]
  |===
  |Key |Architecture |Boost.Build option
  |`x` |x86-32, x86-64 |architecture=x86
  |`a` |ARM |architecture=arm
  |`i` |IA-64 |architecture=ia64
  |`s` |Sparc |architecture=sparc
  |`m` |MIPS/SGI |architecture=mips*
  |`p` |RS/6000 & PowerPC |architecture=power
  |===
  ____
  +
  The two digits following the letter encode the address model as
  follows:
  +
  ____
  [width="66%",cols="16%,39%,45%",options="header",]
  |===
  |Key |Address model |Boost.Build option
  |`32` |32 bit |address-model=32
  |`64` |64 bit |address-model=64
  |===
  ____
`-1_34`::
  _Version tag_: the full Boost release number, with periods replaced by
  underscores. For example, version 1.31.1 would be tagged as "-1_31_1".
`.lib`::
  _Extension_: determined according to the operating system's usual
  convention. On most unix-style platforms the extensions are `.a` and
  `.so` for static libraries (archives) and shared libraries,
  respectively. On Windows, `.dll` indicates a shared library and `.lib`
  indicates a static or import library. Where supported by toolsets on
  unix variants, a full version extension is added (e.g. ".so.1.34") and
  a symbolic link to the library file, named without the trailing
  version number, will also be created.

__ ../../libs/python/doc/html/building/python_debugging_builds.html

==== Test Your Program

To test our subject extraction, we'll filter the following text file.
Copy it out of your browser and save it as `jayne.txt`:

....
To: George Shmidlap
From: Rita Marlowe
Subject: Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?
---
See subject.
....

If you linked to a shared library, you may need to prepare some
platform-specific settings so that the system will be able to find and
load it when your program is run. Most platforms have an environment
variable to which you can add the directory containing the library. On
many platforms (Linux, FreeBSD) that variable is `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, but
on MacOS it's `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and on Cygwin it's simply `PATH`. In
most shells other than `csh` and `tcsh`, you can adjust the variable as
follows (again, don't type the `$`—that represents the shell prompt):

*$* __VARIABLE_NAME__=__path/to/lib/directory__:$\{_VARIABLE_NAME_} *$*
export _VARIABLE_NAME_

On `csh` and `tcsh`, it's

*$* setenv _VARIABLE_NAME_ _path/to/lib/directory_:$\{_VARIABLE_NAME_}

Once the necessary variable (if any) is set, you can run your program as
follows:

*$* _path_/_to_/_compiled_/example < _path_/_to_/jayne.txt

The program should respond with the email subject, “Will Success Spoil
Rock Hunter?”

=== Conclusion and Further Resources

This concludes your introduction to Boost and to integrating it with
your programs. As you start using Boost in earnest, there are surely a
few additional points you'll wish we had covered. One day we may have a
“Book 2 in the Getting Started series” that addresses them. Until then,
we suggest you pursue the following resources. If you can't find what
you need, or there's anything we can do to make this document clearer,
please post it to the link:[Boost Users' mailing list].
